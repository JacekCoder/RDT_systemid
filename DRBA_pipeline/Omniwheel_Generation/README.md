# Omniwheel Generation
## Principles
An omniwheel enables two motions along with two orthogonal axes, i.e. forward and lateral. The omniwheel is a wheel with rollers attached to its circumference. The rollers are free to rotate about their own axes. The rollers are oriented at an angle to the wheel's axis of rotation.
